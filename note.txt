useClearLocalStorage is used to clear localstoreage 
with a given key value

usage,

const clearLocalStorageForKey = useClearLocalStorage();

then use this clearLocalStorageForKey functon with a key to 
remove any localstoreage data

clearLocalStorageForKey("key")

*********************************
useLocalStorage is used to set data in localstoreage.

usage,

  const [value, setValue] = useLocalStorage("value", 0);
  const [data, setData] = useLocalStorage("myData", []);

here we have, [value,setValue] or, [data,setData] 

value,data is the data stored in the localstorage
setValue,setData is used to set data in localstorage

useLocalStorage("key", default value);

useLocalStorage has two parameter
"key" is to set a key.
another one is for a default value.
it is used while initializing

but, here one point is important, if localstorage already
has any value with that given key in the useClearLocalStorage 
then the value of count/data
will be that already stored value, not the default value.

and if there has no value with this key then default value
will be the main data and it's type will be the type that will
be used to store data
